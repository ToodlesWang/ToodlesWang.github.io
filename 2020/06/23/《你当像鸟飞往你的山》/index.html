<h2 id="了解与学习与本书相关的词条"><a href="#了解与学习与本书相关的词条" class="headerlink" title="了解与学习与本书相关的词条"></a>了解与学习与本书相关的词条</h2><h3 id="Mormonism"><a href="#Mormonism" class="headerlink" title="Mormonism"></a>Mormonism</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mormonism</a>，Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity started by Joseph Smith in Western New York in the 1820s and 30s.The word Mormon originally derived from the Book of Mormon, a religious text published by Smith, which he said he translated from golden plates with divine assistance. The book describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas and their dealings with God. Based on the book’s name, Smith’s early followers were more widely known as Mormons, and their faith Mormonism. The term was initially considered pejorative, but Mormons no longer consider it so (although generally preferring other terms such as Latter-day Saint or LDS).After Smith was killed in 1844, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the area that became the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other sects include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy, and other small independent denominations. The second-largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), does not describe itself as “Mormon”, but follows a Trinitarian Christian restorationist theology, and considers itself Restorationist in terms of Latter Day Saint doctrine. Mormonism has common beliefs with the rest of the Latter Day Saint movement, including the use of and belief in the Bible, and in other religious texts including the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. It also accepts the Pearl of Great Price as part of its scriptural canon, and has a history of teaching eternal marriage, eternal progression and polygamy (plural marriage), although the LDS Church formally abandoned the practice of plural marriage in 1890. Cultural Mormonism, a lifestyle promoted by Mormon institutions, includes cultural Mormons who identify with the culture, but not necessarily the theology.</p>
<h3 id="Brigham-Young"><a href="#Brigham-Young" class="headerlink" title="Brigham Young"></a>Brigham Young</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brigham Young</a>was an American religious leader, politician, and settler. He was the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. He founded Salt Lake City and he served as the first governor of the Utah Territory. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the University of Utah and Brigham Young University. Young had many nicknames, among the most popular being “American Moses” (alternatively, “Modern Moses” or “Mormon Moses”), because, like the biblical figure, Young led his followers, the Mormon pioneers, in an exodus through a desert, to what they saw as a promised land. Young was dubbed by his followers the “Lion of the Lord” for his bold personality and commonly was called “Brother Brigham” by Latter-day Saints. A polygamist, Young had 55 wives. He instituted a church ban against conferring the priesthood on men of black African descent, and also led the church during the Utah War against the United States.<br>     <strong>杨百翰至少有55个妻子及57个子女</strong></p>

It expands later, thus we don’t have complete emotions about the present, only about the past.（前言）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>2.我最强烈的记忆不是一段记忆。它是我想象出来的，之后回忆起来就像真的一样。My strongest memory is not memory. It’s something I imagined, then came to remember as if it had happened.（Page14）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>3.最终，母亲说服山下奶奶重新去做宣誓书陈述,说我是二十七号出生的，尽管奶奶仍然相信二十九号才是我的生日。爱达荷州颁发了一份延期出生证明。我还记得信件寄来的那天，当我拿到第一份证明我是个人的法律证据时，我的感觉怪怪的，就好像权利被人剥夺了：在此之前，我从未意识到这还需要证明。 In the end, I got my birth certificate long before Luke got his. When Mother had told the voices on the phone that she thought I’d been born sometime in the last week of September, they’d been silent. But when she told them she wasn’t exactly sure whether Luke had been born in May or June, that set the voices positively buzzing.（Page33）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>4.事实上，她似乎很是兴奋，开始以不同方式讲述这个故事。她很喜欢回忆被警察拦下的那一刻。警察惊奇地发现车后座上有一个不停呻吟的女人,显然正在分娩。“我就切换到脑残女人的模式，”她用越来越洪亮的声音告诉我和奥黛丽，“男人就愿意这么想，是他们拯救了陷入困境的傻女人。我只需靠边站，任他扮演英雄就好了！” In fact, she seemed exhilarated and had begun to tell the story differently, relishing the moment she’d been pulled over by the policeman, who was surprised to find a moaning woman, obviously in labor, in the backseat. “I slipped into the scatterbrained-woman routine,” she told me and Audrey, her voice growing louder, catching hold. “Men like to think they’re saving some brain-dead woman who’s got herself into a scrape. All I had to do was step aside and let him play the hero!”（Page35）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>5.婚后她便致力于构建一个完美家庭，至少外表上如此。她相信这样会保护女儿们免受社会的伤害，不像她过去那样遭人冷眼。其成果之一就是白色的尖桩栅栏和一衣橱的手工缝制衣服。另一个成果是她的大女儿嫁给了一个严厉的年轻人，此人长着一头乌黑发亮的头发，喜欢不走寻常路。也就是说，我母亲对堆积在她身上的体面做出了任性的回应。外婆想把自己从未有过的礼物送给女儿，这个礼物就是一个好的家庭出身。但法耶不想要这个。我母亲虽然不是社会变革者甚至在最叛逆的时期她也谨遵摩门教信仰，忠于婚姻和母性一但二十世纪七十年代的社会剧变似乎至少对她产生了一个影响：她不再想要白色尖桩栅栏和华达呢礼服。She dedicated herself to constructing the perfect family, or at least the appearance of it. This would, she believed, shield her daughters from the social contempt that had so wounded her. One result of this was the white picket fence and the closet of handmade clothes. Another was that her eldest daughter married a severe young man with jet-black hair and an appetite for unconventionality. That is to say, my mother responded willfully to the respectability heaped upon her. Grandma wanted to give her daughter the gift she herself had never had, the gift of coming from a good family. But Faye didn’t want it. My mother was not a social revolutionary—even at the peak of her rebellion she preserved her Mormon faith, with its devotion to marriage and motherhood—but the social upheavals of the 1970s did seem to have at least one effect on her: she didn’t want the white picket fence and gabardine dresses.（Page37）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>6.我参加了外婆的追悼会。在打开的棺材面前，我的目光在她脸上搜寻。殓尸官没处理好她的嘴唇——一直像铁面具般挂在她嘴角的亲切微笑消失了。这是我第一次看到她没了微笑，这时我才终于意识到，外婆生前可能是唯一一个了解我正在经历什么的人：偏执狂和原教旨主义如何瓜分了我的人生，它们如何把我在乎的人从我身边带走,只留下学位和证书一种体面的虚空。现在正在发生的以前也曾发生。母女分离再度重演。磁带在循环播放。 I attended the memorial. It was open casket and I found myself searching her face. The embalmers hadn’t gotten her lips right—the gracious smile she’d worn like an iron mask had been stripped away. It was the first time I’d seen her without it and that’s when it finally occurred to me: that Grandma was the only person who might have understood what was happening to me. How the paranoia and fundamentalism were carving up my life, how they were taking from me the people I cared about and leaving only degrees and certificates—an air of respectability—in their place. What was happening now had happened before. This was the second severing of mother and daughter. The tape was playing in a loop.（Page44）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>7.据奶奶说，一百年前，一支阿帕奇部落曾在那些褪色的岩石上与美国骑兵交战。部落人数不占优势，战斗以他们的失利而告终。剩下能做的便是等死。战斗开始后不久，勇士们就被困在了一块岩脊上。他们不愿遭受战败的耻辱，在奋力突破骑兵队时被一个个砍死，于是骑上马背冲下了山崖。当阿帕奇的女人们在下面的岩石，上找到丈夫们的碎尸时，她们放声痛哭，绝望的眼泪一落到地面，便化作了石头。奶奶从未告诉我们那些女人的结局。阿帕奇部落身陷战事却没有了战士，所以也许是她觉得结局太残酷，没有说出口。我的脑海闪现“屠宰”一词，因为这个词就是为此，为一方毫无抵抗的战斗而设。这是我们在农场用的词。我们屠宰鸡鸭，并不需要与它们战斗一番。勇士们的英勇很可能换来一场屠杀。他们是英雄，死了，而他们的妻子成了奴隶，也死了。我们开车回活动房时，夕阳西下，最后一抹斜阳洒在高速公路上。 我想起了阿帕奇的女人们。和她们的埋骨之地砂岩祭坛一样，她们生命的形状早在多年以前在战马疾驰，拱起栗色的身躯准备迎接最后一击之前，在勇士们最后一跃之前就已注定。女人们如何生存，又如何死去，命运早已注定。由勇士们决定，也由女人们自己决定。像沙粒般数不清的选择，层层压缩，聚结成沉积物，变成岩石，直到最后化为坚固的磐石。 According to Grandma, a hundred years ago a tribe of Apaches had fought the U.S. Cavalry on those faded rocks. The tribe was outnumbered: the battle lost, the war over. All that was left to do was wait to die. Soon after the battle began, the warriors became trapped on a ledge. Unwilling to suffer a humiliating defeat, cut down one by one as they tried to break through the cavalry, they mounted their horses and charged off the face of the mountain. When the Apache women found their broken bodies on the rocks below, they cried huge, desperate tears, which turned to stone when they touched the earth. Grandma never told us what happened to the women. The Apaches were at war but had no warriors, so perhaps she thought the ending too bleak to say aloud. The word “slaughter” came to mind, because slaughter is the word for it, for a battle when one side mounts no defense. It’s the word we used on the farm. We slaughtered chickens, we didn’t fight them. A slaughter was the likely outcome of the warriors’ bravery. They died as heroes, their wives as slaves. As we drove to the trailer, the sun dipping in the sky, its last rays reaching across the highway, I thought about the Apache women. Like the sandstone altar on which they had died, the shape of their lives had been determined years before—before the horses began their gallop, their sorrel bodies arching for that final collision. Long before the warriors’ leap it was decided how the women would live and how they would die. By the warriors, by the women themselves. Decided. Choices, numberless as grains of sand, had layered and compressed, coalescing into sediment, then into rock, until all was set in stone.（Page49）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>8.而我，我从不把那次车祸归咎于任何人，尤其是泰勒。那只是众多事件之一。十年后我的理解会发生转变，我沉重地步入成年，那之后，那次车祸总会令我想起那些阿帕奇女人，想起汇而构成人一生的所有决定——人们共同或者独自做出的那些决定，聚合起来，制造了每一桩单独事件。沙粒不可计数，叠压成沉积物，然后成为岩石。 Me, I never blamed anyone for the accident, least of all Tyler. It was just one of those things. A decade later my understanding would shift, part of my heavy swing into adulthood, and after that the accident would always make me think of the Apache women, and of all the decisions that go into making a life—the choices people make, together and on their own, that combine to produce any single event. Grains of sand, incalculable, pressing into sediment, then rock.（Page54）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>9.我永远忘不了父亲这一刻的样子，强势又绝望。他身体前倾，咬着牙，眼睛眯成一条缝，在儿子的脸上搜寻表示赞同的迹象、共同信念的痕迹，但没有找到。 I will always remember my father in this moment, the potency of him, and the desperation. He leans forward, jaw set, eyes narrow, searching his son’s face for some sign of agreement, some crease of shared conviction. He doesn’t find it.（Page57）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>10.他松开了我的手腕，我倒在地上。我听见他的脚步声穿过了门厅。我站起身来，悄悄地锁上卫生间的门，然后盯着镜子里那个紧握手腕的女孩。她两眼无神，泪珠从脸颊上滑落。我恨她的软弱，恨她有一颗易碎的心。他能伤害她，任何人都能那样伤害她，这不可原谅。我只是因为疼痛而哭泣，我告诉自己，因为手腕疼痛，而不是因为别的。这一刻定义了我对那一晚的记忆，以及之后长达十年之久很多类似的夜晚的记忆。在这样的记忆中，我看到的是一个坚不可摧、像石头一样难以对付的自己。起初我仅仅是让自己相信这一点，直到有一天它变成了现实。然后我才能坦诚地告诉自己，这对我没有影响，他没有影响到我，因为没有什么可以影响我。我不明白我的这种正确是多么病态，不明白自己是如何掏空了自己。尽管我一直被那晚的后果所困扰，但我误解了最重要的事实：它没有影响我，这本身就是它的影响。 He dropped my wrist and I fell to the floor. I could hear his steps moving down the hall. I stood and quietly locked the bathroom door, then I stared into the mirror at the girl clutching her wrist. Her eyes were glassy and drops slid down her cheeks. I hated her for her weakness, for having a heart to break. That he could hurt her, that anyone could hurt her like that, was inexcusable. I’m only crying from the pain, I told myself. From the pain in my wrist. Not from anything else. This moment would define my memory of that night, and of the many nights like it, for a decade. In it I saw myself as unbreakable, as tender as stone. At first I merely believed this, until one day it became the truth. Then I was able to tell myself, without lying, that it didn’t affect me, that he didn’t affect me, because nothing affected me. I didn’t understand how morbidly right I was. How I had hollowed myself out. For all my obsessing over the consequences of that night, I had misunderstood the vital truth: that its not affecting me, that was its effect.（Page131）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>11.比起仁慈，我更能忍受任何形式的残忍。赞美对我来说是一种毒药，我被它噎住了。 I could tolerate any form of cruelty better than kindness. Praise was a poison to me; I choked on it.（Page276）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>12.多年以后我才明白那天晚上发生了什么，我在其中又扮演了什么角色。我是如何在本该保持沉默时开口，却在本该说话时闭上了嘴巴。我们需要的是一场革命，一场自我们童年起就一直扮演的那种古老、脆弱的角色的颠覆。女性需要——埃米莉需要——从托词中解放出来，证明自己是一个人。表达意见，采取行动，蔑视顺从。就像一个父亲那样。 It would be many years before I would understand what had happened that night, and what my role in it had been. How I had opened my mouth when I should have stayed silent, and shut it when I should have spoken out. What was needed was a revolution, a reversal of the ancient, brittle roles we’d been playing out since my childhood. What was needed—what Emily needed—was a woman emancipated from pretense, a woman who could show herself to be a man. Voice an opinion. Take action in scorn of deference. A father.（Page303）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>13.读到这句话的那一刻，我似乎度过了漫长的一生，但那并非我真实的生活。我变成了另一个人，记忆中有不一样的童年。当时我不明白这些文字的魔力，现在也不明白。我只知道一点：当母亲告诉我，说她没有像自己所希望的那样做一个好母亲时，她才第一次成了我的母亲。我爱你。写下这句话后，我合上了笔记本电脑。 I lived a lifetime in the moment I read those lines, a life that was not the one I had actually lived. I became a different person, who remembered a different childhood. I didn’t understand the magic of those words then, and I don’t understand it now. I know only this: that when my mother told me she had not been the mother to me that she wished she’d been, she became that mother for the first time. I love you, I wrote, and closed my laptop.（Page312）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>14.我告诉他们，我曾经贫穷而无知。当我告诉他们这些时，我丝毫不感到羞耻。那时我才明白羞耻感的来源：不是因为我不曾在铺着大理石的音乐学院学习，也不是因为我没有当外交官的父亲：不是因为父亲是半个疯子，也不是因为母案跟着他亦步亦趋。我的羞耻感源自我有一个将我朝吱嘎作响的大剪刀刀刃推去，而不是将我拉走远离它们的父亲；我的羞耻感源自我躺在地上的那些时刻，源自知道母亲就在隔壁房间闭目塞听，那一刻完全没有选择去尽一个母亲的责任。I told them I’d been poor, I told them I’d been ignorant, and in telling them this I felt not the slightest prick of shame. Only then did I understand where the shame had come from: it wasn’t that I hadn’t studied in a marble conservatory, or that my father wasn’t a diplomat. It wasn’t that Dad was half out of his mind, or that Mother followed him. It had come from having a father who shoved me toward the chomping blades of the Shear, instead of pulling me away from them. It had come from those moments on the floor, from knowing that Mother was in the next room, closing her eyes and ears to me, and choosing, for that moment, not to be my mother at all.（Page313）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>15.我知道，作为一个从垃圾堆里爬出来的无知女孩，被允许去那样的地方读书，我应该感沸零才是，但我丝毫提不起热情。我已开始思考教育让我付出的代价，开始对它心生怨恨。I knew I should be drunk with gratitude that I, an ignorant girl who’d crawled out of a scrap heap, should be allowed to study there, but I couldn’t summon the fervor. I had begun to conceive of what my education might cost me, and I had begun to resent it.（Page335）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>16.但辩护井不能战胜负罪感。再多的针对他人的怒火也无法减轻这种负罪感，因为负罪感从来郁与他们无关。负罪感源于一个人对自身不幸的恐惧，与他人无关。But vindication has no power over guilt. No amount of anger or rage directed at others can subdue it, because guilt is never about them. Guilt is the fear of one’s own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people.（Page369）</font></p>
<p><font face="微软雅黑" color=dimgray>17.接下来发生的事零常戏剧化，但真正的戏剧早在卫生间就已上演了。戏剧上演时，不知为何，找无法再穿过子，将十六岁的自己释放出来代替我。在那一刻之前，她一直在那里。无论我看上去发生了多么大的变化——我的教育如何辉煌，我的外表如何改变——我仍然是她，我充其量不过是内心分裂的两个人，她在里面，每当我跨进父亲家的门，她就出现。那天晚上我召唤她，她没有回应。她离我而去，封存在了镜子里。在那一刻之后，我做出的决定都不再是她会做的决定。它们是由一个改头换面的人，一个全新的自我做出的选择。你可以用很多说法来呼这个自找：转变，蜕变，虚伪，背叛。而我称之为：教育。 What followed was very dramatic. But the real drama had already played out in the bathroom. It had played out when, for reasons I don’t understand, I was unable to climb through the mirror and send out my sixteen-year-old self in my place. Until that moment she had always been there. No matter how much I appeared to have changed—how illustrious my education, how altered my appearance—I was still her. At best I was two people, a fractured mind. She was inside, and emerged whenever I crossed the threshold of my father’s house. That night I called on her and she didn’t answer. She left me. She stayed in the mirror. The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self. You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.（Page371）</font></p>
